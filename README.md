# Convert-video-to-jpg-file-by-class-name
Convert video to jpg file by extracting unwanted images - OpenCV - yolov4 - 
We download the Yolo Coco Dataset Model (cfg and weight files) from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/.
We add 80 class names of this model as labels.
Within these classes, we have converted the frames that we want to convert to jpg file - for example, here the frames with people in the video - into jpg file.
